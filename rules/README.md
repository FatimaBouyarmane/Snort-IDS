*How to Use These Files*

Save local.rules and icmp.rules in your Snort rules directory, typically found at */etc/snort/rules/*.
Update your Snort configuration file (snort.conf) to include these rule files:


include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
include $RULE_PATH/icmp.rules

Restart Snort to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart snort


These rules should provide a comprehensive starting point for intrusion detection with Snort.
Modify IP addresses, ports, or thresholds as needed to tailor them to your environment.
