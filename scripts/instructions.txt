Below is a sample simulation_attack.sh script to simulate some basic network attacks, 
such as TCP SYN flood and ICMP ping flood attacks, 
which you can use to test your Snort setup.

This script uses hping3 for TCP SYN flood and ping for an ICMP flood attack. 
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run these commands, 
as they may require root privileges.

1. To run the script: make sure the script has Executable permissions.
    chmod +x simulation_attack.sh

2. Run the Script as Root: Since the script performs network-level attacks, it will typically require root privileges.
sudo ./simulation_attack.sh

3. Choose Attack Option: Follow the on-screen prompts to choose the attack type you want to simulate.
